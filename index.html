                                    <span class="h4" id="p">P</span>aladins first appear in the 8th century as fictional knights of legend similar to the Arthurian Knights of the Round Table. Throughout history the name paladin takes many forms but the meaning and power behind the name remains constant. Modern depictions of paladins are often a holy warrior and combat healer, known for their martial prowess and steadfast resolve in battle. They seek to bring justice, peace, and hope to the world around them and are a source of leadership and inspiration to their comrades and to those in need.

                                    <span class="h4" id="co_name">Paladin Arms – Firearms Training</span> strives to encapsulate the essence of what it means to be a paladin as an individual and part of our communities. Based in Riverside County in Southern California, I specialize in training first time and new firearm owners in the basics of rules, safe handling, and laws, especially as they relate to California. Getting you comfortable with holding and firing your weapon, how it functions, and how to keep it functioning are a big focus as well. I will coach you through the process of buying your first firearm, how and where to acquire ammo, along with any other questions you may have. There are definetly many valuable online resources when it comes to the world of firearms but traversing and sifting through it can be rather daunting; I will help point you in the right direction and show you some valuable resources that helped me along my journey as well. For more info, please check out the packages we offer and feel free to send a message with any questions or concerns you might have. All that said, here are the four key concepts I find essential to what it means to be a modern day paladin!
                                </p>
                                <p class="about_p">
                                    <span class="four_keys">Training</span> is a core concept of excellence in being prepared in your firearms ownership and usage. The more you train (dry fire included) the more comfortable and proficient you will become with your weapons. <br>
                                    <span class="four_keys">Knowledge</span> of your arms is important. Knowing how your arms function, how to work around malfunctions, and how to keep them in good working order is key in keeping yourself and your family safe. Keeping up to date with basic firearms laws, especially in California, is essential to avoid any unnecessary law enforcement entanglements. Know your local laws. <br>
                                    <span class="four_keys">Mental Fitness</span> is essential in being prepared for the rare occurrence you have to brandish and or possibly discharge your weapon in a defensive situation. Realizing the potential consequences of your actions and having the mental fortitude to follow through in a defensive situation could mean the difference between life and death for you and your family. <br>  
                                    <span class="four_keys">Leadership</span> is encouraging others around you in their training, knowledge and mental fitness. Encouraging those who think that firearms are evil things with minds of their own that can run around and kill your family, to learn the truth of these tools and how they function. Lead by example of what it means to be a responsible and knowledgeable firearms owner.
